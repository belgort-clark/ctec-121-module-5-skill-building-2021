## Program to Figure Out Gas Mileage Over a Multiple-leg Journey Using Data From a File

Given a text file with lines of data (gallons, miles):

``` text
15, 200
19, 375
15, 238
```

Write a program that computes the fuel efficiency of a multi-leg journey. The program will first prompt for the starting odometer reading and then get information about a series of legs from a file (the data above). 

For each leg, the program will read a line of data from the file for the gallons and miles, separated by a comma. 

The program should print out the miles per gallon achieved on each leg and the total MPG for the trip.
