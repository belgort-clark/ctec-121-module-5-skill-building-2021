## Heating and Cooling

Heating and cooling degree days are measures used by utility companies to estimate energy requirements.

If the average temperature for a day is below 60, then the number of degrees below 60 is added to the heating degree days.

If the temperature is above 80, the amount over 80 is added to the cooling degree days. 

Write a program that accepts a sequence of average daily temperatures and computes the running total of cooling and heating degree days. 

The program should print these two totals after all the data has been processed.
