# Module 7 - Skill Building Exercise No. 1

## Years to Double an Investment

Write a program that uses a **while loop** to determine how long it takes for an investment to double at a given interest rate. 

The input will be an annualized interest rate, and the output is the number of years it takes an investment to double. 

**Note:** the amount of the initial investment does not matter; you can use $1.

Use the examples from the class that showed you to calculate the future value of an investment. Look through Modules 1 - 3 in Canvas.
